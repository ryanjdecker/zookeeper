## Reflection

### What we learned:

In this project we learned how to look through a codebase to find meaning, how to use architecture-describing tools, how to compare and contrast prescriptive and descriptive architecture practically, and how to add additional functionality to existing software.

### What we would do differently:

In the future we would probably choose a project that is less lightweight and complete; Zookeeper did not have many obvious avenues for improvement so we had to think outside the box for user needs that were not addressed by the system.
